            <h1>New CTO's First 90 Days: Why a Cloud Cost Audit Belongs on Your Checklist</h1>
            <p class="hero-subtitle">Most onboarding playbooks skip infrastructure economics. In fintech, that oversight costs six figures.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <article>
        <p class="lead">You've landed the CTO role at a fintech company. The board expects a technology roadmap. Your CEO wants faster releases. Engineering needs direction. And somewhere in the noise, your cloud bill is quietly bleeding money nobody's tracking.</p>

        <p>Most CTO onboarding guides cover the obvious: meet stakeholders, assess the tech stack, build trust with the team. All critical. But there's one action item that consistently gets buried — or ignored entirely — during the first 90 days: a cloud infrastructure cost audit.</p>

        <p>Here's why that's a mistake, and how to fix it.</p>

        <h2>The Standard 90-Day Playbook (And What It Misses)</h2>

        <p>The typical new-CTO checklist follows a predictable arc. Days 1–30: listen, learn, build relationships. Days 31–60: identify quick wins, assess technical debt, align engineering with business goals. Days 61–90: present a roadmap, start executing.</p>

        <p>It's a sound framework. But it treats infrastructure costs as a "later" problem — something to optimize once you've settled in. In fintech, that delay costs real money.</p>

        <p>Payment platforms, card issuing systems, and banking infrastructure run on compute-intensive, always-on architectures. Transaction processing requires low-latency, multi-region deployments. PCI DSS compliance demands isolated environments, encrypted storage, and redundant logging. KYC/AML pipelines consume significant compute for real-time verification checks.</p>

        <p>All of this translates to cloud bills that scale faster than your transaction volume — unless someone is actively managing them.</p>

        <h2>The Cloud Spending Problem in Numbers</h2>

        <div class="stat-block">
            <div class="stat-item">
                <span class="stat-number">50%</span>
                <p>of FinOps practitioners rank workload optimization and waste reduction as their top priority</p>
            </div>
            <div class="stat-item">
                <span class="stat-number">94%</span>
                <p>of organizations overspend on cloud services, with average overspend hitting 30%</p>
            </div>
            <div class="stat-item">
                <span class="stat-number">$44.5B</span>
                <p>in enterprise cloud infrastructure spend wasted in 2025 on underutilized resources — roughly 21% of total spend</p>
            </div>
            <div class="stat-item">
                <span class="stat-number">43%</span>
                <p>of organizations track cloud costs at the unit level — meaning most can't connect spend to business outcomes</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <p>For fintech companies specifically, the problem compounds. Compliance requirements force multi-environment architectures (production, staging, disaster recovery, audit). Payment processing demands peak-capacity provisioning that sits idle during off-hours. Legacy integrations with banking networks often require dedicated, over-provisioned connectivity. And sandbox environments for scheme certification and testing accumulate costs long after projects ship.</p>

        <p>A new CTO inheriting this infrastructure without conducting a cost audit is flying blind on one of the company's largest operational expenses.</p>

        <h2>Where to Put the Cloud Audit in Your 90-Day Plan</h2>

        <p>Don't wait until Day 60. Start the audit in your first 30 days — alongside stakeholder meetings and team assessments. Here's how it fits into each phase.</p>

        <div class="phase-card">
            <h3>Days 1–30: Discovery and Visibility</h3>
            <p>Your first priority is understanding where money goes. You can't optimize what you can't see.</p>
            <p><strong>Map the cloud footprint.</strong> Identify every cloud account, subscription, and service across all providers. In fintech, it's common to find forgotten AWS accounts from a proof-of-concept that never got decommissioned, or Azure subscriptions tied to a vendor integration that ended months ago.</p>
            <p><strong>Assess tagging hygiene.</strong> Only 43% of organizations track cloud costs at the unit level. If your resources aren't tagged by team, project, and environment, cost attribution is guesswork. Establish a tagging standard immediately — it's the foundation for every optimization that follows.</p>
            <p><strong>Identify the biggest cost centers.</strong> Pull 90 days of billing data and break it down by service, region, and team. Look for the usual suspects: oversized compute instances running 24/7, unattached storage volumes, data transfer charges between regions, and non-production environments that never scale down.</p>
            <p><strong>Benchmark against revenue.</strong> Calculate cloud spend as a percentage of revenue or transaction volume. This gives you a unit economics baseline. One CTO reduced cloud costs from 17% of non-GAAP revenue down to 8% through systematic optimization — that's the kind of impact that gets board attention.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="phase-card">
            <h3>Days 31–60: Quick Wins and Accountability</h3>
            <p>With visibility established, move to action.</p>
            <p><strong>Rightsize compute instances.</strong> This is consistently the highest-impact, lowest-risk optimization. Analyze CPU and memory utilization across production workloads. In payment processing, it's common to find instances provisioned for peak Black Friday traffic running at 15% utilization the other 364 days of the year.</p>
            <p><strong>Shut down idle resources.</strong> Development and staging environments that run 24/7 when engineers work 8–10 hours a day represent pure waste. Implement automated scheduling — stop non-production instances outside business hours. This alone can reduce non-production compute costs by up to 70%.</p>
            <p><strong>Review commitment coverage.</strong> If your predecessor signed reserved instance contracts, evaluate utilization rates. If they didn't, calculate whether savings plans or committed use discounts make sense for your baseline workload. The gap between on-demand pricing and committed pricing ranges from 30% to 72% depending on term and payment structure.</p>
            <p><strong>Assign cost ownership.</strong> Establish clear accountability. Engineering teams should see their cloud spend as part of sprint planning — not as an invisible line item that only finance reviews monthly. This cultural shift matters more than any single technical optimization.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="phase-card">
            <h3>Days 61–90: Governance and Long-Term Framework</h3>
            <p>Now institutionalize what you've built.</p>
            <p><strong>Implement cost anomaly detection.</strong> Set up automated alerts for spending spikes. In fintech, a misconfigured autoscaling policy or a runaway batch job can generate five-figure bills overnight. Catch anomalies in hours, not at month-end reconciliation.</p>
            <p><strong>Embed cost review into architecture decisions.</strong> Every new service, every new integration, every infrastructure change should include a cost estimate. Tools like Infracost can surface cost implications during pull requests — before code reaches production.</p>
            <p><strong>Build a FinOps practice.</strong> Even a lightweight version. Assign someone — whether it's a platform engineer, a DevOps lead, or a dedicated FinOps practitioner — to own cloud cost optimization as an ongoing discipline. One-time audits find savings. Continuous practices prevent waste from recurring.</p>
            <p><strong>Report to the board.</strong> Present your findings: current spend, waste identified, savings achieved, projected optimization. For a CTO in their first 90 days, demonstrating financial discipline alongside technical vision builds credibility fast.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Why This Matters More in Fintech</h2>

        <p>Cloud cost management isn't just an engineering concern in financial services — it's a regulatory and strategic one.</p>

        <div class="callout">
            <p><strong>Compliance drives infrastructure complexity.</strong> PCI DSS requires network segmentation, encrypted storage, and comprehensive logging. PSD2 mandates secure communication channels for open banking APIs. MiCAR introduces new requirements for crypto-asset service providers. Each regulation adds infrastructure layers, and each layer adds cost. Without active management, compliance architecture becomes compliance-driven waste.</p>
        </div>

        <p><strong>Transaction economics depend on infrastructure efficiency.</strong> If you're building a payment platform processing millions of transactions, your cost-per-transaction includes cloud infrastructure. Optimizing that cost directly improves unit economics — a metric your investors and board track closely.</p>

        <p><strong>Scaling amplifies inefficiency.</strong> A 10% waste rate on a $50K monthly cloud bill is manageable. That same 10% on a $500K bill after Series B scaling is $600K per year in avoidable spend. The time to build cost discipline is before you scale, not after.</p>
